# ft_nm

The "ft_nm" project requires you to recreate the functionality of the "nm" command, which is used to display the symbol table of ELF binaries (including x86_32, x64, object files, and shared libraries). The program must be written in C, with a Makefile to compile the project. The output should resemble the system's "nm" command, including order, offset, and padding, while handling errors gracefully. The project involves parsing and managing ELF files carefully, ensuring correct handling of architecture, flags, offsets, -a, -g, -u, -r, and -p.
